// Worktree branch protocol — the root-cause fix for the cross-worktree branch collision.
// Every task's four stages (Prep/Implement/Review/Land) run in SEPARATE fresh worktrees and hand the
// branch off through origin. Git allows a branch to be checked out BY NAME in only one worktree at a
// time, and a stage's worktree isn't reliably torn down before the next stage starts — so a lingering
// sibling that holds the branch name strands the next stage ("fatal: '<branch>' is already used by
// worktree ..."). The fix: NO stage ever holds the branch by name. Every stage works in DETACHED HEAD
// (HEAD pointing straight at the commit, not via the branch ref) and publishes with an explicit
// refspec. Detached HEADs at the same commit never collide, so the one-branch-per-worktree rule can
// never fire. This also immunises against a fresh worktree starting on an unrelated base commit: the
// fetch+detach lands every stage on the right tree regardless of where its worktree started.
const WORKTREE_PROTOCOL = (branch) =>
  `WORKTREE BRANCH PROTOCOL (critical — do not deviate): your worktree is fresh and may start on an unrelated commit. NEVER run \`git checkout ${branch}\` / \`git switch ${branch}\` — a named checkout locks the branch and the sibling stages in other worktrees must be able to read it (git forbids the same branch in two worktrees). Always work in DETACHED HEAD: get the code with \`git fetch origin ${branch} && git checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD\`, and publish commits with \`git push origin HEAD:${branch}\`.`

// Supply-chain lockdown is intentional on this machine (docs/agents/locked-down-npm.md). A stage must
// NEVER weaken it to get unblocked — that turns a one-task hiccup into a machine-wide security hole.
const SECURITY_NOTE =
  `SUPPLY-CHAIN LOCKDOWN (do not circumvent): this machine deliberately blocks dependency build/install scripts and packages published <7 days ago. In a fresh worktree, \`pnpm install\` prints \`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS\` (e.g. esbuild) and EXITS 1 — this is EXPECTED AND BENIGN, not a broken environment: the deps install fine and esbuild/vitest ship prebuilt binaries that work without their postinstall. Do not chase that exit code. Just run the package-local binaries directly — \`./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit\` to typecheck, \`./node_modules/.bin/vitest run\` to test — instead of \`pnpm run <script>\` (whose pre-flight rejects the ignored-builds state). NEVER run \`pnpm config set dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds ...\`, never lower \`min-release-age\`/\`minimumReleaseAge\`, never edit \`~/.npmrc\` or the global pnpm config — a flailing agent once did this globally and silently defeated the whole lockdown. If a package TRULY needs its build script and has no prebuilt fallback, set the blocker and surface it; a human allows it per-repo (pnpm-workspace.yaml). See docs/agents/locked-down-npm.md.`
