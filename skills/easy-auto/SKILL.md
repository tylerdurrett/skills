description: Orchestrate an issue through decomposition (if slice sized), iterative plan review, parallel worktree execution, independent code review, and a final pull request using sub-agents. Use when the user says "/easy-auto", asks to complete a whole slice without separate task issues or PRs, or wants context-preserving sub-agent orchestration.

I will provide a GitHub issue. It may be slice sized or task sized. You will act as orchestrator, preserving your own context window by delegating all planning and decomposition, plan review, plan revision, coding, code review, and code revision to sub agents. You'll use worktrees and parallel sub agents where possible.

## Planning

### Slice Sized Issues: Full Decomposition Plan

Rather than using the full workflow that involves creating separate issues and PRs for each task, handle the whole slice yourself.

Have an agent decompose the slice into a DAG of individual tasks that are one story point and self contained.

Then, have an agent review that planned DAG of work to ensure it's coherent and meets the full intent of the issue. If there are issues, have an agent update/review the plan. Repeat until you have a reviewed plan that is acceptable.

### Task Sized Issues: Single Task Plan

You do not need to decompose the task, consider it decomposed already. However, you should still use an agent to create a plan and another agent to review the plan. If the review agent has findings, send back to the plan agent to fix, and review again. Repeat until the plan comes back clean.

## Execution

Once you have your accepted plan, whether slice sized or task sized, delegate the work of completing the plan to sub agents as needed, parallelizing what you can and using worktrees.

Each block of work will need to be reviewed by an independent agent. Check for correctness, codebase hygiene and best practices, opportunities for simplification, and make sure the intent of the block of work is achieved.

Send back to a sub agent to fix any issues, and repeat until the block of work passes.

Once everything comes back, review ALL the work against the original stated goals from the parent issue. Send back to agents as needed until it's ready for a PR.

Open the pr and leave me on a branch for the PR so I can review. 

You know how to best structure the agent delegations so I'll leave the details of that to you.
